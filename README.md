# Deep Reinforcement Learning
 Build and test DRL Algorithms in different environments.
 Each folder in the archive contains all the needed files to run the notebooks to train an agent.
 The target of this repository is to implement and experiment with different algorithms to learn and better understand the methods. For this purpose I developed a modular library that allows to easily test different algorithms in different environments. The library is still in a very early stage of development and it is not yet ready to be published.
