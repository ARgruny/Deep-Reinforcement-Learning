# Deep Reinforcement Learning
 Build and test DRL Algorithms in different environments. 
 Each folder contains all the needed files to run the notebooks with the experiment. 
 The target of this repository is to implement and experiment with different algorithms to learn and better understand the methods.
 The environments used are mainly smaller envs to enable the methods to run on average notebooks.
